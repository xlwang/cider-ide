CIDER, which stands for Cloud Integrated Development Environment and Repository, is online software aimed at providing a rich collaborative IDE for developers in multiple common programming languages. Currently in its infancy, we are looking for developers willing to invest some time and shape the future of the project. Our current idea is to use Google Wave as the back of the IDE to allow for real time communication, with a robot doing the code markup, editing, and coloring.
